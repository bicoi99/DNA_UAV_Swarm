# DNA_UAV_Swarm
Welcome to team Defend Now Attack (DNA) github page. We are a team that represent the University of Southampton in the BAE 2020 UAV Swarm Challenge.

## DNA_Eyes
This is the sub-group within our team that is reponsible for providing vision for the team.
So far I have created a folder for my sub-group to experiment with OpenCV, particularly the Hough Transform for circle detection. Several other image processing techniques are to be explore when completing the tasks provided (colour segmentation, grayscaling, thresholding, Canny edge detection etc.).
